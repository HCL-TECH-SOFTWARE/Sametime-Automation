# -------------- Parameters for NEW environment --------------
# -------------- These servers will be installed by the script --------------

# IP Address of Kubernetes API Server (= Master node)
# Use it when there are multiple network interfaces on your Master node, and you want to select
# the specific one for cluster communication.
# If you do not have problems with Kubernetes cluster initialization, keep it empty.
# Used in: kubernetes-install
kubernetes_apiserver_ip: '192.168.10.140'

# For each service, you have to choose how it will be exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster.
# You have two options: via Ingress or via Load Balancer.
#
#   * If you choose Ingress, then the service will use the IP address of Ingress and
#     you have to specify a unique hostname for this service.
#     Without this hostname, a service could be inaccessible because multiple services
#     are exposed through this Ingress IP address, and hostname is a way how to distinguish them.
#
#   * If you choose Load Balancer, then each service will obtain a unique IP address
#     from the Load Balancer pool of IP addresses. You do not need to specify a dedicated hostname
#     for such service in this config file because the hostname will not be used in the script.
#     You can access the service via IP address or via hostname.
#
# In all cases, in your DNS server configuration, you have to set resolving
# from hostname to IP address for ALL services. Otherwise, they will not be accessible
# for users.
#   (example: meetings.company.com resolves to sametime_meetings_assigned_ip_address).

# Used in: kubernetes_addons_install
metallb_ip_range: '192.168.10.150-192.168.10.160'
# This is the pool of IP addresses used by MetalLB for assigning external addresses
# to services with expose type = loadbalancer.
# Usually, they are from the same network as IP addresses for nodes (virtual machines with Linux),
# but they cannot overlap! MetelLB IP range must have only unoccupied addresses.

# Select whether the script will obtain TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt Staging or Production Certificate Authority.
# Always start with Staging. Once Staging works, switch here to Production (set variable to false)
